# Dialect Word Mining in Turkish Speaking

This repository accompanies the final submission for the **COS7045-B Advanced Machine Learning** module. It focuses on identifying and analyzing dialect-specific vocabulary from spoken Turkish, Kurmancî (Kurdish), and Zazakî using automatic speech recognition (ASR), word mining, and graph-based knowledge representation.

## Project Overview

This project aims to:
- Transcribe speech data using pretrained and fine-tuned ASR models
- Extract and analyze frequent words across dialects
- Visualize vocabulary overlaps and distinctions
- Construct a frequency-based knowledge graph showing word co-occurrence relationships

The pipeline supports future research in dialect-aware AI and helps preserve underrepresented languages in digital NLP systems.

## Technologies Used

- Hugging Face Transformers (Whisper, Wav2Vec2)
- Mozilla Common Voice datasets (Turkish, Kurmancî, Zazaki)
- NetworkX for knowledge graph construction
- Matplotlib for visualization
- Pandas & JiWER for evaluation and WER scoring
